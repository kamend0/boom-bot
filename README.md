# boom-bot Discord bot

A really simple bot that plays a sound clip saved in the same directory whenever someone joins the chat.

That person cannot just be moving from one voice chat to another, they need to fully disconnect, then connect to the chat that the bot is in.

As of this build, the commands are:
!!join - the bot will join whichever voice chat you are in, and not play the sound clip; will send a message if you are not in a chat
!!leave - the bot will leave the chat that it's in, and send a message if it isn't in one

Uploading for convenience and as a jumping-off point for future projects.
